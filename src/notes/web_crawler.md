# Web Crawler Multithreaded
## Follow-up Questions
1. Assume we have 10,000 nodes and 1 billion URLs to crawl. We will deploy the same software onto each node. The software can know about all the nodes. We have to minimize communication between machines and make sure each node does equal amount of work. How would your web crawler design change? 
2. What if one node fails or does not work? 
3. How do you know when the crawler is done?

## Answers
### 1. Minimizing communication between nodes and ensuring load balance
To handle a large number of URLs and minimize communication between nodes:

Partitioning the URL space: Divide the URLs based on their hostname. Each node can be responsible for crawling a specific range of hostnames. This can be done by hashing the hostnames (e.g., using consistent hashing) to distribute URLs evenly across nodes. The hash value will determine which node is responsible for crawling that specific hostname, ensuring minimal overlap between nodes.

Distributed work queues: Use a distributed work queue like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ. Each node pulls URLs to crawl from the queue. By balancing the queue across multiple nodes, you ensure that nodes get a fair share of the work. A node picks a task from the queue when it becomes available.

Local caching: Each node should maintain a cache of already visited URLs (using a distributed cache like Redis) to avoid redundant crawling. This will reduce the need for inter-node communication, as each node can quickly check the global cache to see if a URL has already been visited.

### 2. Handling node failure
Handling node failure is critical in a distributed system:

Checkpointing and fault tolerance: Implement checkpointing so that nodes periodically save the progress of their crawling to a central location (e.g., distributed storage like Amazon S3 or a database like Cassandra). If a node fails, another node can pick up from the last checkpoint and continue crawling without starting from scratch.

Task redistribution: If a node fails or becomes unresponsive, its assigned URLs or tasks can be reassigned to another node. The distributed task queue should track which URLs are currently being processed. If a node does not complete its tasks within a certain time frame (heartbeats or a timeout), another node can take over those tasks.

### 3. Knowing when the crawler is done
Determining when the crawling process is complete is tricky in a distributed system. Some strategies include:

Distributed completion detection: Use a barrier synchronization mechanism where each node signals when it has completed its assigned tasks. Once all nodes have signaled completion, the crawler knows it is done. Tools like Zookeeper can be useful for managing distributed synchronization.

Polling empty queues: Each node can regularly poll the work queue to see if there are no more URLs to process. If all nodes report no more URLs and the queue is empty, the crawler can conclude that the entire job is finished.

Centralized task tracking: Maintain a central task tracker that monitors the number of URLs crawled and the number of URLs remaining. When the number of tasks remaining hits zero, the crawling job is complete.


Summary for Large-Scale Distributed Web Crawling:

- Partition the URL space using consistent hashing for minimal inter-node communication.
- Use distributed work queues for fair load balancing and task distribution.
- Implement checkpointing and fault tolerance for node failures.
- Use barrier synchronization or task tracking to determine when the crawling process is complete.
- This design ensures scalability, fault tolerance, and effective management of distributed nodes while minimizing communication overhead.
